# Project Title

My name is Mariam Frimpomaa Adusei a frontend specialisation student of alx.
This project was entitiled Ewiem which is a local name for the word weather in Ghana (my home country).
This project is about weather reading and forecasting for a location over a particular period of time.
In ghana we rely mostly on the weather conditions for our outdoor activities like weddings, funerals, laundry etc. Here there is a minimal access to dryers or washing machines for our laundry thereby the need for reliable and easy access to weather conditions of the city.and this drived me into making a weather application. 
I was also able to play around APIs while applying my knowledge earned from frontend.
